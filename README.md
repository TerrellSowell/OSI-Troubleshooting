## OSI Troubleshooting

This Network Lab project aimed to establish deepen understanding on how to troubleshoot at every OSI layer. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze every potential troubleshooting layer approach on the network, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world issue scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to gain experience with real Cicso equipment to understand network security, troubleshoot patterns, and bottom-up strategies.

Layer 1(Physical)-Are all cables correctly inserted? Are the cable ends bent or worn out? Has somebody forgotten to add the corrct speed to the interface? Has the speed of the Ethernet port been set correctly? Has thr interface been opened for use by the Network Admin?
Layer 2(Data Link)-Has the correct protocol been applied to the interface so it agrees with the other side, such as Ethernet/PPP/HDLC?
Layer 3(Network)-Is the interface using the correct IP address and subnet mask?
Layer 4(Transport)-Is the correct routing protocol being used, and is the correct networking being advertised from the router?
