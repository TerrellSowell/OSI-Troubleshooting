## OSI Troubleshooting

This Network Lab project aimed to establish deepen understanding on how to troubleshoot at every OSI layer. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze every potential troubleshooting layer approach on the network, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world issue scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to gain experience with real Cicso equipment to understand network security, troubleshoot patterns, and bottom-up strategies.

Layer 1(Physical)-Are all cables correctly inserted? Are the cable ends bent or worn out? Has somebody forgotten to add the corrct speed to the interface? Has the speed of the Ethernet port been set correctly? Has thr interface been opened for use by the Network Admin?
Layer 2(Data Link)-Has the correct protocol been applied to the interface so it agrees with the other side, such as Ethernet/PPP/HDLC?
Layer 3(Network)-Is the interface using the correct IP address and subnet mask?
Layer 4(Transport)-Is the correct routing protocol being used, and is the correct networking being advertised from the router?

The most important part of troubleshooting any problem is to divide the tasks of problem resolution into a systematic process of elimination. Cisco has broken this process into eight steps:

- Define the problem.
- Gather detailed information.
- Analyze the information. Consider probable cause for the failure.
- Devise a plan to solve the problem.Eliminate potential causes.
- Implement the plan. Propose Hypothesis
- Test Hypothesis. Observe the results of the implementation.
- Repeat the process if the plan does not resolve the problem.
- Document the changes made to solve the problem.
- 
 **Troubleshooting methods through the OSI stack include these three methods:**

**Troubleshooting Methods:**
- Comparing Configurations
- Trace the Path
- Swap out Components
